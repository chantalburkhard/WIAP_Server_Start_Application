# Server Start Application - part of a university project
The Application starts the [Photon PUN 2](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) network and creates a room so other devices using a different unity application can join (you should not do something like that because it makes working with photon quite difficult and near impossible to synchronize game objects across the network without deep diving into the complex world of networking). 

Hint: The application is not needed anymore.
